# Sudoku-Classic
## Introdution
This is a Sudoku Solver developed using backtracking algorithm. This is my first GUI based project I learned online from the genius Tim Ruscica. Below you can find some basic instructions on how to play the game.
## Instructions
The puzzle involves a 9Ã—9 grid of squares divided into 9 different sub-boxes. In total there are 81 squares on the sudoku grid and when the puzzle is completed each square will contain exactly one number. You can click on each empty square in any order to fill the box with a number from 1 to 9 so that each box, vertical column and horizontal row can only contain each number from 1 to 9 once. To confirm the value press ENTER, to remove the value press DEL. A red 'X' on the bottom left corner would mean a wrong entry. You can also press SPACE if you want the algorithm to do the work for you.
